The Muslim League were demanding a separate independent states since their 1940 Lahore resolution. In 1946, they'd agreed to a three-tier structure: a centre, groups of provinces, and provinces. In July 1946, it withdrew its agreement to the plan and announced a general strike (hartal) on 16 August.

By 1940, Muslim League "volunteer corps" / private army had 4154 members according to a British report. Since the 11–14 February 1946 riots in Calcutta, communal tension had been high. Following Jinnah's declaration the Muslim League government announced a general holiday - despite Congress protests. On 14 August, Kiron Shankar Roy called on Hindu shopkeepers to keep their businesses open. Muslim newspapers (eg Star of India) published the programme for the day detailing procession routes. Muslim League branches were advised to depute three workers in every mosque in every ward to explain the League's action plan before Juma prayers - with clear comparisons to Prophet Muhammad's conquest of Mecca and establishment of the kingdom of Heaven in Arabia.

On the day, Muslim crowds (30-50k by 4PM) gathered at a maidAn. During Suhrawardy's speech, he said that the military and police were restrained (though police did not receive any such order). Prominent Muslim League leaders (including Suhrawardy) later spent a great deal of time in police control rooms directing operations and obstructing police duties - but the British Governor did not stop them. 

Attacks on Hindus started right after the meeting, and by 5:30PM, men could be seen carrying loot. Trucks came in carrying Muslim gangsters with brickbats and bottles. A 6 pm curfew was imposed in the parts of the city. Besides significant participation from butchers, dock-workers, masons and mill-workers, mob frenzy was directed by criminals such as 'Bombaiya' of New Market and  Munna Choudhuri in the Harrison Road. Ambulences were mobilized and petrol couplons issued in the names of minsters were used.

Noted Hindu toughmen, Gopal Patha (a goat butcher) and Jugal Chandra Ghosh (who ran an akhAra) soon raised teams of vigilantes, plus reward money and carried out defence and retaliatory attacks (Beliaghata area and the Miabagan basti).

Worst of the killings happened on 17th August.  Especially, Syed Abdullah Farooqui - workers union leader and Elian Mistry led a huge armed mob to Kesoram Cotton Mills and slaughtered workers. By late afternoon, soldiers were called in. On 21 August, Bengal was put under Viceroy's rule.
