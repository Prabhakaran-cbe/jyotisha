Michael O'Dwyer, Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab from 1913 to 1919, endorsed Dyer and called the massacre a "correct" action. O'Dwyer was assassinated in London in 1940 by Udham Singh.

Responses polarized both the British and Indian peoples. The army was retrained and developed less violent tactics for crowd control. Britain never formally apologised for the massacre but expressed "regret" in 2019.

Dyer was allowed to resign and settle in Britain. Huge funds were raised, including contributions by civil servants and Army officers and presented to the butcher; while families of the victims received Rs 500 (then equal to £37.10s.0d; equivalent to £1,497 in 2019) each after long delay. Dyer suffered a series of strokes during the last years of his life and he became increasingly isolated due to the paralysis and speechlessness inflicted by his strokes.
