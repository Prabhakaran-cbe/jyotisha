Humiliated Tipu vowed to take down "the contemptible wall". The fine wall held up till 15th April. Then he managed a 1km wide breach after 1 month of sustained artillery fire and poured in - only to be foiled again at Alwaye river bank. He retreated by 24 May 1790 to defend his kingdom from British threat.
