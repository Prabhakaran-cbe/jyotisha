The Dutch captive-turned general of padmanAbhapura's mArtANDa varma, De Lannoy, had built an excellent fortification from coast to mountain - neDuMkoTa. It had a 16 feet wide and 20 deep ditch. dharmarAja rAma varma had tried to get British help when Tipu's attack was imminent, but only got words. The Dutch, who'd sold forts to rAma varma helped a bit - by sending an engineer von Krause, who was dispatched to the wall. He wrote an account of the battle.

When Tipu attacked, he tried filling a small portion of the ditch with cotton sacks and moving in a small column via a narrow passage. At first the Mysoreans overpowered three batteries of the Lines but subsequently their flanks were subjected to fire from the woods. They were so surprised by the first round of fire that they fell into disorder. Then the well drilled nair army advanced and the confusion increased. Those Mysoreans who had not yet been trampled down by their horses while retreating found that the sacks with cotton, used for filling up the ditch when they set out, as well as some powder-barrels, had caught fire. This forced them to jump from the ramparts.
