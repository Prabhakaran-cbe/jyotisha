On 18 October, Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy personally communicated with Gandhi, appraising him of the massacre of Hindus in Noakhali and the plight of the Hindu women. At the evening prayer event, he mentioned this, and decided to visit Noakhali. Gandhi started for Noakhali on 6 November and reached Chaumuhani the next day.  In the next seven weeks, he covered 116 miles and visited 47 villages. He organized prayer meetings, met local Muslim leaders, and tried to win their confidence. Still, stray incidents of violence and murder continued.

Gandhi's stay in Noakhali was resented by the Muslim leadership. On 12 February 1947, while addressing a rally at Comilla, A. K. Fazlul Huq said that Gandhi's presence in Noakhali had harmed Islam enormously. Towards the end of February 1947, it became vulgar. Gandhi's route was deliberately dirtied every day and Muslims began to boycott his meetings. Gandhi discontinued his mission halfway and started for Bihar on 2 March 1947 at the request of the Muslim League leaders of Bengal. On 7 April, more than a month after leaving Noakhali, Gandhi received telegrams from Congress Party workers in Noakhali, describing attempts to burn Hindus alive. He responded that the situation in Noakhali required that the Hindus should either leave or perish.
